# Guitar Sales Data Analysis

This project contains a basic data analysis workflow for a fictional guitar sales dataset. It demonstrates how to use the pandas library in Python for data exploration and visualization with matplotlib.

## Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand sales performance by identifying best-selling products (by quantity and revenue) and exploring sales trends over time. The data is synthetic, generated to simulate sales data for a store like Guitar Center.

## Project Structure

├── guitar_sales.csv    <- The generated CSV file containing the sales data.
└── <main>.py <- The Python script used for data generation and analysis.
└── README.md           <- This file.
└── LICENSE             <- Contains the MIT License text.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <(https://github.com/PedroDaim/GuitarCenterData)>
    cd <GuitarCenterData>
    ```

2.  **Dependencies:**
    This project requires the following Python libraries:
    * pandas (`>=1.0.0`)
    * matplotlib (`>=3.0.0`)

    You can install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Running the script:**
    Execute the Python script to generate the data, perform the initial analysis, and display visualizations:
    ```bash
    python <main>.py
    ```

## Data Generation

The Python script generates a CSV file (`guitar_sales.csv`) containing fictional sales data with the following columns:

* `Sale ID`: Unique identifier for each sale transaction.
* `Sale Date`: Date of the sale.
* `Product Category`: Type of instrument or accessory (e.g., Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar).
* `Brand`: Brand of the product (e.g., Fender, Gibson).
* `Model`: Specific model of the product.
* `Price`: Selling price of the item.
* `Quantity`: Number of units sold in the transaction.

## Analysis Performed

The script currently performs the following analysis:

* **Data Loading and Inspection:** Loads the `guitar_sales.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame and displays initial information (head, tail, info, describe, dtypes).
* **Duplicate Check:** Checks for and counts any duplicate rows in the DataFrame.
* **Best-Selling Products (by Quantity):** Groups the data by 'Product Category' and 'Brand' to calculate the total quantity sold for each combination and visualizes the top sellers using a bar chart.
* **Best-Selling Products (by Revenue):** Calculates the revenue for each sale, groups the data by 'Product Category' and 'Brand' to find the total revenue generated by each, and visualizes the top revenue generators using a bar chart.

## Next Steps (Future Work)

Here are some potential next steps for this analysis:

* Explore sales trends over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly sales).
* Analyze the average transaction value.
* Investigate the distribution of sales across different product categories.
* Look for correlations between different product purchases.
* Add more detailed data, such as customer information or store location, for more advanced analysis.
